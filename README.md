# theMnemonicBranching

- Worked a little on the UI
- Added the save button
- Somehow the new frame is assigned as the video so the video get's generative, might need to have a look at the variable hierarchy

## Run the project
Use this command in the project folder:
python3 -m http.server

## To-do list
- **UI**
    - General layout: 
    - Fixe the green squares exceed the camera recording and leave a trace in the sketch
    - Loading states are static, would be cool if we could add a spinner animation or something when the models are loading

- **Artwork**
    - The image is not being edited right now. Look for generative methods to mess up the image taken from the webcam


- **More Title Ideas**
    - In Questioning of the Given
    - This is You
    - i didn't do it, computer did
    - What Pixels See
    - Mother of Randomness
    - You are Here
    - In the name of all the artworks out there
